| #   | Layer            | Function                                          | Analogy                                        |

| 7️⃣ | **Application**  | Interface for user apps (browser, email)          | Writing a letter                               |
| 6️⃣ | **Presentation** | Translates, encrypts, compresses data             | Translating language or encrypting your letter |
| 5️⃣ | **Session**      | Manages sessions between devices                  | Making or hanging up a phone call              |
| 4️⃣ | **Transport**    | Ensures complete data delivery                    | Making sure the package arrives completely     |
| 3️⃣ | **Network**      | Decides the route (IP)                            | Selecting postal route                         |
| 2️⃣ | **Data Link**    | Prepares data for the physical link (MAC address) | Addressing the package                         |
| 1️⃣ | **Physical**     | Transmits raw bits over wires                     | The postal truck, wires, or Wi-Fi waves        |


## Trick to remember (from top to bottom):

All People Seem To Need Data Processing
