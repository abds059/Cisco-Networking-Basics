# Communication Standards

## How A Device Views The Network ?

Topologies help us to view the different devices in a network and help us in identifying end devices and intermediary devices. Think of a device as in a bubble. But a single device knows only its assigned personal addressing information. 

- So how does a device know the following ?
    - On which network it is on ?
    - Is the destination device on my network or on another network ?
    - Where do I send information when destination device is on different network ?
    - Did the destination device received the sent information ?
    - Do I need to resend any information ?

The answer is protocols.

- **PACKETS** 
    - Most network communication are broken down into smaller data units called packets.

## What Is A Standard ?

A set of rules that determine how something can be done.

- Networking and Internet standards ensure that all devices connected to the network implement same set of rules or protocols in same manner.

- Standards enable different types of devices to send information to each other through the internet.

- For eg, an email is formatted, forwarded and received by all devices according to a standard. If a person sends email through a personal computer, other person can view it with his smart phone as long as both devices use the same standard.

### Network Standard Organizations

- IEEE
- IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
- IETF
- ICANN (The Internet Corporation For Assigned Names And Numbers)
- ITU
- TIA

#### Formation Of An Internet Standard ?

- An internet standard is the end result of comprehensive cycle of discussion, testing and problem solving.

- These standard are developed, published and maintained by variety of organizations which are mentioned above.

- When a new standard is proposed each stage of development and approval process is recorded in no of **Request For Comments (RFC)** so that evolution of standard is tracked.

- RFC's for internet standards are published and managed by **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**.
