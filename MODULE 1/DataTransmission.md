# DATA TRANSMISSION

## Data

- **Volunteer Data**
    - Data that you offer yourself (That we agree to share)

- **Inferred Data**
    - Generated by our activities (For eg, you use your credit card in a foreign country so your bank will have info from that transaction committed that you travelled to that foreign country)
    - Not intentionally voluntered

- **Observed Data**
    - Like data being collected from location option on device

## A Bit 

- Abbreviation of ***binary digit***
- Smallest piece of data
- Humans interpret words and pictures while computers only interpret patterns of bits
- Bit is stored and transmitted as one of two possible discrete states (usually 0 or 1)
- Input devices 
    - Translate human interaction into binary code
- Output Devices
    - Takes binary data and translate back into human recognizable form
- In ASCII each character is represented in ***8 bits*** (A byte)
- Codes can be used to represent almost any type of conversation digitally (eg, computer data, graphics, voice, video, audio, music)

## Methods Of Data Transmission
    After data is converted into series of bits it must be converted into signals that are transmitted through a network medium

#### What is Media ?

    - Physical medium on which signals are transmitted
    - For eg, copper wire, fibre-optic, electro-magnetic waves through air

#### Signals

    - Consists of electrical or optical patterns transmitted from one device to another
    - These patterns represent digital bytes

### Common Methods Of Signal Transmission

- #### Electrical Signals
    Transmission achieved by representing data as electrical signals on copper wire 
     - signals -> electrical 
     - medium -> copper wire

- #### Optical Signals
    Transmission achieved by by converting electrical signals to light pulses
     - signals -> electrical
     - medium -> light pulses

- #### Wireless Signals
    Transmission achieved by using infrared, microwaves or radio waves through air
     - signals -> infrared, micro, radio waves
     - medium -> air

```
In most homes and small business network signals are transmitted along
- copper wires (cables) OR
- WIFI enabled wireless connections

Larger networks employ fibre-optics in order to reliably carry signals across long distances
