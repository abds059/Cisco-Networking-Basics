## Bandwith

- Capacity of medium to carry data
- Amount of data that can flow from one device to another in a given time
- Typically measured as no of bits that can be sent per second
    - Thousand bits per second (Kbps)
    - Millions of bits per second (Mbps)
    - Billions of bits per second (Gbps)
- Determined and affected by physical media properties, current technologies and laws of physics
- Theoretically at optimal (ideal) condition

## Throughput

- Amount of data sent or received over a connection including delays (latency)
- Less than Bandwith
- The amount of data, type of data, and latency of the network combine to cause throughput to not match bandwidth
