# Network Media Types

- Network media provides channel on which data is transmitted from source to destination

## Types Of Media

- Primarily **three** types

    - **Metal Wires Within Cables** -> Data is encoded into electrical impulses
    - **Glass or Plastic Fibres Within Cables (Fibre Optic Cables)** -> Data is encoded into pulses of lights
    - **Wireless Transmission** -> Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves

## Criteria For Choosing Network Media

- **Four** main criterias 

    - Max distance a media can succesfully carry a signal
    - Environment in which media will be installed
    - Amount of data and req speed of data transmission 
    - Cost of media and installation

## Common Network Cables

- ### Twisted Pair Cables

    - Wires grouped into pairs and twisted around each other to reduce interference
    - A pair of wire posses same color with one having solid color while other having same color with white background
    - Most common type of network cable
    - Ethernet technology generally uses twisted pairs to connect devices

- ### Coaxial Cable

    - Earliest type of cabling
    - Used by cable TV providers and for connecting various components which make up satellite communication systems
    - Single rigid copper core that conducts the signal
    - The copper core is surrounded by 
        - Layer of insulation
        - Metal shielding
        - Protective jacket
    - Used as transmission line to carry high freq and broadband signals

- ### Fibre Optic Cable

    - Either glass or fibre with diameter about the same as human hair
    - Carries digital information at very high speeds over long distances
    - High bandwith enabling them to carry huge amount of data
    - No electrical interference cuz light pulses are used
    - Used in 
        - Backbone networks
        - Large enterprise environments
        - Large data centres
        - Telephone companies
    - Also used in medical imaging, medical treatment and mechanical engineering inspection
