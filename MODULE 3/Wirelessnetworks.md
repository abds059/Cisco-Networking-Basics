# Wireless Networks

```
Mobile phones use radio waves to transmit voice signals to antennas mounted on towers located in specific geographic areas. When a telephone call is made, the voice signal is relayed from one tower to another tower until it is delivered to its destination. This type of network is used when you make a phone call to another mobile phone or to a wired telephone. It is also used to send text messages directly from the phone. The most common type of cellular telephone network is called a GSM network. The abbreviations 3G, 4G, 4G-LTE, and 5G are used to describe enhanced cell phone networks that are optimized for the fast transmission of data. Currently, 4G still dominates as the current mobile network used by most phones.

In addition to the GSM and 4G/5G transmitters and receivers, smartphones make connections in a variety of ways.

- ### GPS(Global Positioning System)
    - Uses satellites to transmit signals that cover the globe
    - Smartphones can receive this signal and can locate phone's location up to an accuracy within 10m

- ### Wifi
    - Wifi transmitters and receivers located within the smartphone helps it to connect to local networks and the internet
    - In order to send and receive data, the phone needs to be in range of a wireless access point
    - Usually private owned but often provide guests or public service hotspots
    - **Hotspot** -> An area where wifi signals are available

- ### Bluetooth
    - Low power, short range wireless technology
    - Intended to replace wired connection for accessories like headphones, speakers, microphones, smartwatches
    - Used to transmit both data and voice so favourable to form small local networks
    - Used for short distance communication b/w devices
    - Can connect to multiple devices at a time (Max 8 devices)

- ### NFC(Near Field Communication)
    - Wireless communication technology that enables data to be exchanged by devices that are in close proximity to each other (less than few centimeters)
    - Uses electromagnetic fields to transmit data
    - For example, to connect a smartphone and payment system


### Terminologies

- ***SSID*** -> name assigned to a wireless network
- ***Passphrase*** -> Normally used as the wireless password
