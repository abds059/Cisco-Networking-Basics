# ISP Services

- An ISP (internet service provider) provides a link b/w home network and the internet
- Each ISP connects to other ISP's to to form a network of links that interconnect users all over the world
- ISP's are connected in hierarchial manner to ensure that internet traffic reaches destination in shortest time possible

## ISP Connections

- Interconnection of ISP's form the backbone of internet
- It is complex web of fibre optic cables with expensive networking switches and routers that directs the flow of information b/w source and destination hosts

- **Simplest ISP Connection Example**
    - Single PC, ISP, and a modem that connects both
    - Not preferred cuz your computer is not protected on the internet

- **Common ISP connection**
    - Multiple PC's connected to a ***wireless integrated router*** which further connects to the ISP through a modem
    - Safer method
    - The router
        - Has switch to connect wired hosts and and a wirelss AP(access point) to connect wireless hosts
        - Also provides client IP addressing information and security for inside hosts
    
## Cable And DSL Connections

- ### Cable
    - Offered by cable television service providers
    - Internet data signal is carried on a coaxial cable
    - Provides 
        - High bandwith
        - Always on connection to internet
    - Special cable modem
        - Seperates internet data signal from other signals on the cable
        - Provides an ethernet connection to hosts computers or LAN

- ### DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
    - Provides high bandwith , always on connection to internet
    - Requires a high speed modem
        - To seperate DSL signal from telephone signal
        - To provide ethernet connection to host computer or LAN
    - DSL runs over a telephone line which is split into three channels
        - Voice telephone calls channel (Allows users to receive phone calls without disconnecting from internet)
        - A faster download channel (To receive information from internet)
        - A channel for sending or uploading information (Slightly slower than download channel)

    - **Quality and Speed** of a DSL connection depend on:
        - Quality of phone line
        - Distance from central office
        
    - Farther the distance from central office, slower the connection.

## Additional Connectivity Options

- ### Cellular 
    - Uses cellphone network to connect
    - Performance limited by capabilities of phone and cell tower to which it is connected
    - Real benefit for:
        - People in areas who would have otherwise no internet connection  
        - For people who are constantly on move
    - Downside is that the carrier usually meters the bandwith usage of connection and may charge extra for bandwith that exceeds the contract data plan

- ### Satellite
    - Good options for homes and offices that donot have access to DSL or cable 

    - **Disadvantages**
        - High setup and equipment costs
        - Satellite dishes require a clear line of sight to satellite so might face difficulties in overly wooded areas or places with overhead obstructions.  

- ### Dial-Up Telephone
    - Inexpensive option
    - Uses any phone line and a modem
    - To connect to ISP user calls the ***ISP access phone number***
    - Useful for mobile access while travelling 
    - Not suitable for large data transfer
    - Should be considered when high speed connection options are not available
