# FTP Clients And Servers

## FTP Client
- The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) provides an easy method to transfer files from one computer to another
- A host running FTP client software can access an FTP server to perform various file management functions including file uploads and downloads

## FTP Server
The FTP server enables a client to exchange files between devices
- It also enables clients to manage files remotely by sending file management commands such as delete or rename
- To accomplish this, the FTP service uses two different ports to communicate between client and server

## Method
- To begin an FTP session, control connection requests are sent to the server using destination TCP port 21
- When the session is opened, the server uses TCP port 20 to transfer the data files


- FTP client software is built into computer operating systems and into most web browsers
- Stand-alone FTP clients offer many options in an easy-to-use GUI-based interface
