# Web Clients And Servers

## HTTP And HTML

- When a web client receives the IP address of a web server (By DNS)
    - The client browser uses that IP address and port 80 to request web services
    - This request is sent to the server using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

- When the server receives a port 80 request
    - The server responds to the client request
    - Sends the web page to the client
- The information content of a web page is encoded using specialized 'mark-up' languages
- The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) coding tells the browser how to format the web page and what graphics and fonts to use
- HTML is the most commonly used language

- The HTTP protocol is not a secure protocol; information could easily be intercepted by other users as data is sent over the network
- In order to provide security for the data, HTTP can be used with secure transport protocols
- Requests for secure HTTP are sent to port 443
- These requests use https in the site address in the browser, rather than http

- There are many different web servers and web clients available
- The HTTP protocol and HTML standards make it possible for these servers and clients from many different manufacturers to work together seamlessly
