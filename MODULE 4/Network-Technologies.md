# Home Network Technologies

## LAN Wireless Frequencies

- **Bluetooth** 
    - 2.4Ghz Band limited to short range, low speed communication
    - One to many communication 

- **Modern Wireless LAN Technologies**
    -  2.4Ghz - 5Ghz that conform to various IEEE ***802.11*** standards
    - ***802.11*** transmit at much higher level than bluetooth giving them longer range and improved throughput
    - Certain areas of electromagnetic spectrum can be used without permit

## Wired Network Technologies

Most commonly implemented wired protocol is the ***Ethernet protocol***

- **Category 5e Cable**
    - Most common wiring used in LAN
    - Consist of 4 pairs of wires that are twisted to reduce electrical interference

- **Coaxial Cable**
    - Has inner wire surrounded by a tabular insulating layer which is surrounded by a tabular conducting shield
    - Most coaxial cables also have an external insulating sheath or jacket

- **Fibre Optic Cable**
    - Can be either glass or plastic with a thickness equivalent to a human hair
    - Can carry information at high speed over long distances
    - Have very high bandwith enabling them to carry large amounts of data
