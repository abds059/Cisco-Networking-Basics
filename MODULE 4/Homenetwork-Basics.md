    - Ports are seperated into seperate networks
        - Local Network (Can be wired like you can connect an Ethernet cable and connect it to a device and all the devices will be on the same network)
        

## Typical Home Network Router

- Two primary types of ports

    - **Ethernet Port** ***(Labeled as LAN)***
        - Connect to the internal switch portion of the router
        - All devices connected to the switch port are on the same local network

    - **Internet Port** ***(labeled as WAN)*** 
        - Used to connect the device to another network
        - Connects the router to a different network than the Ethernet Port
